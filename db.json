      "recipe":"To prepare a delectable Chicken Biryani, start by marinating the chicken in a mixture of yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, biryani masala, red chili powder, and salt, allowing it to soak in the flavors for at least 30 minutes. In a pot, sauté finely sliced onions in a blend of oil and ghee until they turn a rich golden brown. Introduce whole spices such as bay leaves, cardamom, and cinnamon to infuse the aromatic essence. Add the marinated chicken to the pot and cook until the chicken is well-sealed and coated with the flavorful masala. Parboil basmati rice separately and layer it over the chicken, generously sprinkling each layer with fried onions, fresh mint, and coriander leaves. "
